This App allows for an easy diglot weave for the Hebrew Bible and Greek New Testament.

# Usage

Set the minimum frequency value for the target language vocabulary entering a number in the `Enter vocab minimum` and click the `Generate` button. All words occurring less that that number of times will be replaced with their English gloss. 

# Issues

I'm not sure how to join the Hebrew words properly given the structure of the source data. 

# Sources

 - Both Greek and Hebrew data is taken from [Clear Bible Alignments](https://github.com/Clear-Bible/Alignments)
 - Wordlist data gathered from [Vocabulary Tools](https://github.com/jtauber/vocabulary-tools) by James Tauber.
